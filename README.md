# 🧮 Excel Macros For Everyone

This repository contains different types of Excel macros that can help you in any office task or any project where you use Microsoft Excel.

Each folder in this repository represents a different excel macro whose main purpose is to solve a specific problem or set up a configuration.

As time goes by I will be adding as many macros as I can. If you are passionate about this topic, your future contributions are welcome.
